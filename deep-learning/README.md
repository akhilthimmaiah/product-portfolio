# Deep Learning Projects

This folder contains step-by-step implementations of foundational and advanced deep learning concepts. Each notebook or script is organized to demonstrate key ideas in a clear and progressive manner.

## Topics Covered

- **Neural Networks**: Forward/backward propagation, activation functions, loss functions
- **CNNs**: Convolution, pooling, padding, image classification
- **RNNs**: Sequence modeling, backpropagation through time
- **Object Detection**: Sliding windows, region proposals, basic YOLO

## Purpose

These exercises are part of my deep learning coursework and self-driven exploration, with a strong focus on implementation and clarity.
